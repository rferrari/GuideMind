**Migrating from Heroku to Render**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of migrating your existing Heroku application to Render. This migration process will ensure a smooth transition of your application's functionality, performance, and scalability. We'll walk you through the key differences between Heroku and Render, transferring data from Heroku to Render, and setting up a new deploy on Render.

**Understanding the Differences between Heroku and Render**
--------------------------------------------------------

Before diving into the migration process, let's highlight some key differences between Heroku and Render:

### Professional Features

*   Heroku: Offers a variety of professional features, including support for multiple services, custom domains, and SSL certificates.
*   Render: Provides a more streamlined and modern approach, focusing on simplicity and ease of use. Render also supports multiple services and custom domains.

### Multi-Service Architectures

*   Heroku: Allows you to create complex multi-service architectures using Heroku Connect, Heroku Postgres, and other services.
*   Render: Supports multi-service architectures using Render's built-in services, such as Redis, Postgres, and more.

### Troubleshooting Deploys

*   Heroku: Provides a robust troubleshooting system, including logs, metrics, and more.
*   Render: Offers a simplified troubleshooting experience, with detailed logs and metrics.

### Deploying a Specific Commit

*   Heroku: You can deploy a specific commit using `git push heroku <branch-name>`.
*   Render: You can deploy a specific commit using `git push render <branch-name>`.

### Deploy from a Registry

*   Heroku: Supports deploying from a registry using Docker.
*   Render: Supports deploying from a registry using Docker, with additional features like automated builds.

### Environment Variables & Secrets

*   Heroku: Allows you to set environment variables and secrets using Heroku config.
*   Render: Allows you to set environment variables and secrets using Render's environment variables and secrets feature.

### Default Environment Variables

*   Heroku: Provides a set of default environment variables, including `HEROKU`, `HEROKU_API_KEY`, and more.
*   Render: Provides a set of default environment variables, including `RENDER`, `RENDER_API_KEY`, and more.

### Create your first workflow

*   Heroku: Requires creating a custom workflow or using Heroku's built-in workflows.
*   Render: Offers a simple workflow creation process, with pre-built templates and customization options.

### Key Value (Redis-compatible)

*   Heroku: Supports Redis using Heroku Redis.
*   Render: Supports Redis using Render's Key Value store, a Redis-compatible solution.

### Creating & Connecting

*   Heroku: Requires creating a Redis instance and connecting to it.
*   Render: Allows you to create a Key Value store and connect to it with ease.

**Transferring Data from Heroku to Render**
--------------------------------------------

To transfer data from Heroku to Render, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Export Data from Heroku

*   Use the Heroku CLI to export your data using the `heroku config` command.
*   Export data from your Heroku database using the `heroku pg:export` command.

### Step 2: Import Data to Render

*   Use the Render CLI to import your data using the `render config` command.
*   Import data into your Render database using the `render pg:import` command.

**Setting up a new deploy on Render**
--------------------------------------

To set up a new deploy on Render, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a new Render project

*   Create a new Render project using the Render dashboard or CLI.
*   Choose a project name, select the programming language, and configure the environment variables.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables and Secrets

*   Set environment variables and secrets using Render's environment variables and secrets feature.
*   Use the Render CLI to set environment variables and secrets.

### Step 3: Deploy Your Application

*   Use the Render CLI to deploy your application using a specific commit or branch.
*   Configure automated builds and deployment using Render's workflow feature.

**Best Practices and Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
-------------------------------------------------

When migrating from Heroku to Render, keep the following best practices and common pitfalls in mind:

### Best Practices

*   Plan your migration carefully, considering the differences between Heroku and Render.
*   Use Render's built-in services and features to simplify your migration process.
*   Test your application thoroughly after migration to ensure a smooth transition.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

*   Failing to transfer data correctly from Heroku to Render.
*   Not configuring environment variables and secrets properly.
*   Not testing your application thoroughly after migration.
