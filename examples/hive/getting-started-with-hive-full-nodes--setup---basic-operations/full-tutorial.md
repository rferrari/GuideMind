**Getting Started with Hive Full Nodes: Setup & Basic Operations**
=============================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Welcome to the world of Hive, a decentralized social network and blockchain platform. As a web3 developer, you're likely familiar with the concept of full nodes, which play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and decentralization of the network. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through setting up a Hive full node, connecting to the network, and performing basic read/write operations using the API.

**Intro to Hive: Web2 vs Web3 Developer Workflow**
---------------------------------------------------

Before we dive into the technical aspects, let's briefly discuss the differences between Web2 and Web3 development workflows. In Web2, developers typically interact with centralized services, such as databases and APIs, which are controlled by a single entity. In contrast, Web3 development involves interacting with decentralized networks, like blockchain and peer-to-peer protocols, which are maintained by a community of participants.

**Setting Up a Full Node**
-------------------------

A full node is a node that stores a complete copy of the blockchain, allowing it to verify and validate transactions. To set up a full node, you'll need to:

### Step 1: Choose an OS

Select a compatible operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, or macOS).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies, including Node.js, Git, and make.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs git make
```

### Step 3: Clone the Hive Codebase

Clone the Hive codebase using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ Hive/hive.git
```

### Step 4: Build and Compile the Code

Build and compile the Hive codebase using make.

```bash
cd hive
make
```

**Connecting via RPC**
----------------------

To interact with the Hive network, you'll need to connect to a node using RPC (Remote Procedure Call). You can use a pre-configured node or set up your own.

### Step 1: Choose an RPC Node

Select a pre-configured RPC node, such as `https://api.hive.network`.

### Step 2: Install the Hive Client

Install the Hive client using npm.

```bash
npm install @hive/hive-js
```

### Step 3: Connect to the RPC Node

Connect to the RPC node using the Hive client.

```javascript
const Hive = require('@hive/hive-js');

const rpcNode = 'https://api.hive.network';
const hive = new Hive(rpcNode);
```

**Performing Read Operations**
------------------------------

Once connected, you can perform read operations using the Hive API.

### Step 1: Get Account Information

Get information about a specific account.

```javascript
const account = 'youraccountname';
const accountInfo = await hive.getAccounts([account]);
console.log(accountInfo);
```

### Step 2: Get Account History

Get the transaction history for a specific account.

```javascript
const account = 'youraccountname';
const accountHistory = await hive.getAccountHistory(account);
console.log(accountHistory);
```

**Broadcasting Transactions**
------------------------------

To broadcast transactions, you'll need to create a new transaction and sign it with your private key.

### Step 1: Create a New Transaction

Create a new transaction using the Hive client.

```javascript
const fromAccount = 'youraccountname';
const toAccount = 'recipientaccountname';
const amount = '0.001 HIVE';
const transaction = hive.createTransaction(fromAccount, toAccount, amount);
```

### Step 2: Sign the Transaction

Sign the transaction with your private key.

```javascript
const privateKey = 'yourprivatekey';
const signedTransaction = hive.signTransaction(transaction, privateKey);
```

### Step 3: Broadcast the Transaction

Broadcast the transaction to the network.

```javascript
const broadcastResult = await hive.broadcastTransaction(signedTransaction);
console.log(broadcastResult);
```

**Troubleshooting Common Issues**
---------------------------------

### 1. Node Not Syncing

If your node is not syncing, check the logs for any errors or warnings.

### 2. RPC Node Down

If the RPC node is down, try connecting to a different node or check the status of the node.

### 3. Transaction Not Broadcasting

If a transaction is not broadcasting, check the transaction ID and try broadcasting it again.

**Conclusion**
---------------

In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of setting up a Hive full node, connecting to the network, and performing read/write operations using the API. Remember to always follow best practices and troubleshoot common issues to ensure a smooth experience.
