**Deploy Your First Static Site with Render**
====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Welcome to this tutorial on deploying a simple static site to Render. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating a deployable project and deploying it to Render using a static site generator. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of Render's features and be able to deploy your own static site.

**Step 1: Setting up a new project on Render**
--------------------------------------------

To get started, you'll need to create a new project on Render. Follow these steps:

### 1.1 Create a new project on Render

1. Go to [Render](https://render.com/) and click on the "Create Project" button.
2. Fill in the required information, such as project name, description, and region.
3. Click on the "Create Project" button to create a new project.

### 1.2 Set up a Git repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub or another Git hosting platform.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. Create a new branch for your project using `git branch`.

**Step 2: Creating a static site with a static site generator**
---------------------------------------------------------

In this step, we'll create a simple static site using a static site generator. We'll use Hugo, a popular and easy-to-use generator.

### 2.1 Install Hugo

1. Install Hugo on your local machine using the following command:
```bash
brew install hugo
```
For Windows users, download the Hugo installer from the official website.

### 2.2 Create a new Hugo project

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
2. Run the following command to create a new Hugo project:
```bash
hugo new site mysite
```
Replace `mysite` with your desired project name.

### 2.3 Configure Hugo

1. In the `config.toml` file, add the following configuration:
```toml
title = "My First Static Site"
baseURL = "https://mysite.com"
theme = "hugo-lambda"
```
Replace `https://mysite.com` with your desired site URL.

### 2.4 Create content

1. Create a new file in the `content` directory called `index.md` with the following content:
```markdown
# My First Static Site

Welcome to my first static site!
```
### 2.5 Build the site

1. Run the following command to build the site:
```bash
hugo
```
This will generate a new directory called `public` containing your static site.

**Step 3: Deploying the site to Render**
---------------------------------------

In this step, we'll deploy the site to Render using the `render` CLI tool.

### 3.1 Install the Render CLI tool

1. Install the Render CLI tool using the following command:
```bash
brew install render-cli
```
For Windows users, download the Render CLI installer from the official website.

### 3.2 Create a new Render app

1. Run the following command to create a new Render app:
```bash
render create mysite
```
Replace `mysite` with your desired app name.

### 3.3 Configure the Render app

1. In the `render.yml` file, add the following configuration:
```yml
name: mysite
build:
  docker:
    image: node:latest
    command: ["npm", "install", "&&", "npm", "run", "build"]
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  env:
    - Render_URL
```
### 3.4 Deploy the site

1. Run the following command to deploy the site:
```bash
render deploy
```
This will deploy your site to Render.

**Practical Tips and Best Practices**
--------------------------------------

* Use a static site generator like Hugo to create a maintainable and scalable site.
* Use environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys.
* Use a Git repository to version control your site and collaborate with others.
* Use Render's built-in features like multi-service architectures and key-value stores to build complex applications.

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
---------------------------

* Don't forget to configure your Render app's build process.
* Don't forget to set up environment variables for your site.
* Don't forget to version control your site using Git.

**Conclusion and Next Steps**
-----------------------------

Congratulations! You've deployed your first static site to Render. From here, you can explore more features of Render, such as multi-service architectures and key-value stores. You can also experiment with different static site generators and build complex applications using Render's built-in features.

------------------------

* Render's official documentation: [https://render.com/docs](https://render.com/docs)
* Hugo's official documentation: [https://gohugo.io/documentation/](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)
* Git's official documentation: [https://git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)

**Troubleshooting Deploys**
---------------------------

If you encounter any issues during the deploy process, refer to Render's troubleshooting guide: [https://render.com/docs/troubleshooting](https://render.com/docs/troubleshooting)

**Deploying a Specific Commit**
------------------------------

To deploy a specific commit, use the following command:
```bash
render deploy --commit <commit_hash>
```
Replace `<commit_hash>` with the hash of the commit you want to deploy.

**Deploy from a Registry**
-------------------------

To deploy from a registry, use the following command:
```bash
render deploy --registry <registry_url>
```
Replace `<registry_url>` with the URL of your registry.

**Environment Variables & Secrets**
-----------------------------------

To store sensitive information like API keys, use environment variables in your Render app's `render.yml` file. For example:
```yml
env:
  - API_KEY
```
You can then access the API key in your site's code using the following syntax:
```bash
export API_KEY=${API_KEY}
```
**Default Environment Variables**
------------------------------

Render provides several default environment variables that you can use in your app. For example, `RENDER_URL` returns the URL of your Render app.

**Create Your First Workflow**
-----------------------------

To create a new workflow, use the following command:
```bash
render workflows create
```
This will create a new workflow in your Render app.

**Key Value (Redis-compatible)**
-------------------------------

To create a new key-value store, use the following command:
```bash
render kv create
```
This will create a new key-value store in your Render app.

**Creating & Connecting**
-------------------------

To create a new service, use the following command:
```bash
render services create
```
This will create a new service in your Render app. You can then connect your service to your app using the following command:
```bash
render services connect <service_name>
```
Replace `<service_name>` with the name of your service.
